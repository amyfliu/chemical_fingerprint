Load the required packages
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
```


```{r}
#load original data file: 7,170 compounds
filtered_tox21 = read.delim("./data/clusters.txt") #cas, cluster

#load the aggregated file with CAS and SMILES: 19,334 rows
aggregated_tox21 = read_xlsx("./data/tox21_aggregated.xlsx") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  rename(ncgc = sample_id) %>% 
  select(cas, smiles) #cas, smiles

#extract the unique CAS and smiles --> 7,872
aggregated_tox21_2 <- aggregated_tox21[!duplicated(aggregated_tox21[, c("cas", "smiles")]), ]

#test = aggregated_tox21 %>% unique()
```

Combine data using the cas as the "key"
```{r}
data_combined = 
  left_join(filtered_tox21, aggregated_tox21_2, by = "cas") %>% 
  distinct() #7170 rows

#length(unique(data_combined$cas)) #7,170 unique rows
```

Check if there are missing values:
```{r}
#sum(is.na(data_combined$smiles))
#NOTE: we don't have the smiles for 140 of the compounds

#after removing all non-complete rows, we are left with 7170 - 140 = 7030 observations...
not_missing = data_combined %>% remove_missing()

#Find which compounds/drugs are actually missing the "SMILES" 
missing = data_combined %>% filter(is.na(smiles)) #140
```

```{r eval=FALSE}
test = read_xlsx("./data/tox21_aggregated.xlsx") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  rename(ncgc = sample_id) %>% 
  select(cas, pubchem_sid)

z = left_join(missing, test, by = "cas") %>% 
  distinct() %>% 
  select(cas, pubchem_sid, cluster)

write_csv(z, "./result/smiles_missing.csv")

data_combined = 
  left_join(filtered_tox21, aggregated_tox21_2, by = "cas") %>% 
  distinct()

write_csv(missing, "./result/missing_smiles_csv")

#cluster_and_smiles = data_combined %>% select(cluster, smiles)
#write_csv(cluster_and_smiles,"./result/cluster_and_smiles.csv")
```


#create output file (cas, cluster, smiles)
```{r}
write_csv(not_missing, "./result/cluster_and_smiles.csv")
```


#create csv with cluster and smiles
cluster_and_smiles = final_data %>% select(cluster, smiles)
write_csv(cluster_and_smiles, "./result/cluster_and_smiles.csv")

write.table(cluster_and_smiles, file = "./result/cluster_and_smiles.txt", sep = "\t")
